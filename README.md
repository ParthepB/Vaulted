# Vaulted
A lightweight web app that lets users capture, organize, and revisit personal memories. It provides a clean interface for adding moments, tagging them, and browsing them later through a simple recap view. Designed to be fast, minimal, and easy to build on, this project serves as a foundation for a personal digital memory archive.
